# final-project

final project of multimodal machine learning

The final project is in final.ipynb

Since I don't have GPU now, I cannot run the program, leading to unmodified shape for generator.

I've implement the structure for it by using resnet (basically same to the paper), so YOU may need to modify the shape and change the generator in the program to newgenerator.(if you want to change discriminator too, please implement it in newdiscrimninator, the paper still use conv network for discriminator)

See newgenerator part for more details in final.ipynb

The paper's implentation is also paste here, for more about paper, see [https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE]()
