# Final-project

Final project of multimodal machine learning

The main codes are train.py, model.py, dataset.py and parser.py. The default values of parser.py are already the best values of hyper-parameters. Other codes are from deep learning course and SPADE([https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE]()). We refered a small part of them.
